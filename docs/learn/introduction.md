### Welcome!

Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of Bee nodes that collectively provide censorship resistant, decentralised storage and communication services. Swarm's mission is to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets by providing scalable base-layer data storage infrastructure for the decentralised internet. Its incentive system is enforced through smart contracts on the Gnosis Chain blockchain and powered by the xBZZ token, making it economically self-sustaining.
